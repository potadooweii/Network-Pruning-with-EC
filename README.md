Final project of evolutionary calculation, lectured by Ying-Ping Chen. NYCU 2023 Fall.

See main.py for example of usage.

Default resnet18 with input image of (64,64)  
Default vgg11 with input image of (224,224) <- the (64,64) also available now.

The automatically loaded model would be the one without postfix (i.e. vgg11_MNIST.pt, resnet18_MNIST.pt etc.),
which means if you want to use (64,64)-vgg11, you should modify the file name.
